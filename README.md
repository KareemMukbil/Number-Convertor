# Number-Convertor
This is my first public GitHub project. It's not much, but I'm still learning. It supports base 2, 10, and 16 conversions
# How I Made It:
**What I used:** It's written using the IntelliJ IDE, programmed in Java. Also used JavaFX
# Reflection
I've made tons of projects before, but those were mostly made for learning. This one on the other hand, was a challenge I gave myself; no course, no instructor, told me to make this. I made it out of my own volition, and I don't think it turned out too bad for a first time.
# Help
**You have three fields to complete:** \
\
**Convert From:** In here you choose one of the three bases (decimal, hexadecimal or binary), that your number will be inputed in.\
**Conver To:** What base you would like to convert your number to (decimal, hexadecimal or binary).\
**Your Number:** Input your number. Attention, it has to correspond to the base you gave earlier in the *Convert From* field.

**What Comes After?**\
\
The result will then appear in the requested base. If you ever need to see the other conversions; just click on *Show Other Conversions*. And *Restart* to input a new conversion.
